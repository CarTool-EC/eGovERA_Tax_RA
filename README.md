# eGovERA_Tax_RA
The eGovERA Tax Reference Architecture was created in the context of  Action 2016.32 of the ISA² Programme and is being maintained under the Digital Europe Programme (DEP). The EIRA uses (and extends) the ArchiMate language as a modelling notation and uses service orientation as an architectural style.
