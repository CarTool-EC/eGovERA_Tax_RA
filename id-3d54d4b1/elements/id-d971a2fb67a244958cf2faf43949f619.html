Additional information: The right to certainty of information refers to the principle that individuals should have access to clear, accurate, and reliable information. This is particularly relevant in the context of digital technologies, where information is often complex and rapidly changing. 

The right to certainty of information encompasses several key aspects. Firstly, it implies that information should be presented in a way that is easy to understand, without unnecessary jargon or technical language. This is often referred to as the principle of 'plain language'.

Secondly, the right to certainty of information means that individuals should be able to trust the information they receive. This includes ensuring that information is accurate, up-to-date, and reliable. It also means that individuals should be able to verify the source of the information, and that any potential conflicts of interest are clearly disclosed.

Thirdly, the right to certainty of information involves the right to access information. This means that individuals should be able to obtain the information they need, when they need it. This includes both proactive disclosure of information by organizations, as well as the right to request and receive information.

In the context of digital technologies, the right to certainty of information also involves issues such as data protection and privacy. This includes the right to know what data is being collected about them, how it is being used, and who it is being shared with.

Overall, the right to certainty of information is a fundamental principle that underpins the responsible use of digital technologies. It is essential for ensuring that individuals can make informed decisions, protect their rights, and hold organizations accountable.
