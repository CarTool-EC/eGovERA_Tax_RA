Additional information: A Financial Service Provider is an entity that offers a range of financial services to both individuals and businesses. This role is crucial in the financial ecosystem as it facilitates various financial transactions and services, including but not limited to, lending, investing, insurance, payment services, and money management.

In the context of the European Taxes Regulation, the Financial Service Provider's role becomes even more critical. They are responsible for ensuring compliance with all relevant tax laws and regulations. This includes the accurate calculation and timely payment of taxes, as well as the preparation and submission of necessary tax reports and documents. They must also keep abreast of any changes in tax laws and regulations, and adjust their practices accordingly to maintain compliance.

The Financial Service Provider is also responsible for advising their clients on tax-related matters. This could involve providing guidance on tax-efficient investment strategies, helping businesses understand and take advantage of tax incentives, or assisting individuals with their personal tax planning.

Furthermore, as an ArchiMate business role, the Financial Service Provider is expected to align their operations and strategies with the overall business architecture. This means they must understand and adhere to the business's vision, strategy, governance, and key processes.
