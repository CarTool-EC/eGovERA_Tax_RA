Additional information: The Tax Digital Public Service Consumers Catalogue ABB is a comprehensive list of all the business actors that interact with tax-related digital public services. These actors play various roles in the tax system, from administration and regulation to compliance and dispute resolution. The catalogue is designed to provide a clear understanding of the different roles and responsibilities in the tax system, and to facilitate the development and implementation of digital public services in the tax sector.

Example: For instance, the 'Social Security Administration' is a business actor responsible for administering social security programs, while the 'Business' actor represents businesses that interact with digital public services for tax purposes. 'Citizen' represents individual taxpayers who use digital public services for their tax affairs. 'Customs Authority' and 'Statistical Authorities' are involved in the regulation and monitoring of tax-related activities. 'Quality Control Authority' ensures the standards and compliance in tax-related activities. 'Public Administration' and 'Tax Administration' are overarching actors responsible for the overall administration and regulation of the tax system. 'Tributary Justice Court' and 'Tax Ombudsman' are involved in resolving tax-related disputes. 'Temporary Excise Taxpayers' and 'Registered Excise Tax Payer' represent different types of taxpayers in the excise tax system.
