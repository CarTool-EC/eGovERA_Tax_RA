Carbon emissions primarily refer to carbon dioxide (CO2), a GHG that significantly contributes to global warming. Non-carbon emissions, on the other hand, include other GHGs like methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases, as well as non-GHG pollutants like sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). In the IT sector, these emissions can be produced both directly, through the operation of data centers and other infrastructure, and indirectly, through the production and disposal of hardware.

Additional information: Carbon and non-carbon emissions refer to the release of gases and particulates into the atmosphere that are produced as a result of various activities, primarily industrial processes, energy production, and transportation. These emissions can have significant impacts on the environment, contributing to issues such as air pollution, climate change, and damage to the ozone layer.

Carbon emissions specifically refer to the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other carbon compounds. These are primarily produced through the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas, as well as through deforestation and other land-use changes. Carbon emissions are a major contributor to global warming, as CO2 is a potent greenhouse gas that traps heat in the Earth's atmosphere.

Non-carbon emissions, on the other hand, include a wide range of other gases and particulates that are released into the atmosphere. These can include sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and various other pollutants. While these emissions do not contribute to global warming in the same way as carbon emissions, they can still have significant environmental impacts. For example, SO2 and NOx can contribute to the formation of acid rain, while PM can have harmful effects on air quality and human health.

In the context of information technology (IT), carbon and non-carbon emissions are a significant concern. The IT sector is a major consumer of energy, much of which is still produced from fossil fuels. This means that the operation of data centers, servers, and other IT infrastructure can result in significant carbon emissions. In addition, the production and disposal of IT equipment can also result in non-carbon emissions, due to the use of various chemicals and materials in these processes.

As a result, there is a growing focus on reducing both carbon and non-carbon emissions in the IT sector. This can be achieved through a variety of strategies, including improving energy efficiency, transitioning to renewable energy sources, implementing better waste management practices, and designing equipment to be more durable and recyclable.

Example: 1. Smart Grids: In the European IT context, smart grids are being developed to manage electricity usage more efficiently. These grids use carbon/non-carbon emissions data to balance the supply and demand of electricity, reducing the need for fossil fuel-based power generation and thus lowering carbon emissions.

2. Carbon Footprint Tracking Apps: Several European IT companies have developed mobile applications that allow users to track their carbon footprint. These apps use data on carbon/non-carbon emissions to calculate the environmental impact of an individual's lifestyle choices, such as their mode of transport or dietary habits.

3. Data Centers: Many European IT firms are now focusing on reducing the carbon footprint of their data centers. They use carbon/non-carbon emissions data to optimize energy usage, often through the use of renewable energy sources and energy-efficient hardware.

4. Smart Cities: European cities are increasingly using IT solutions to become 'smart cities'. This involves using carbon/non-carbon emissions data to manage urban services more efficiently, such as public transport, waste management, and energy usage, with the aim of reducing the city's overall carbon footprint.

5. Supply Chain Management: IT solutions are being used to manage supply chains more sustainably. This involves using carbon/non-carbon emissions data to assess the environmental impact of different stages of the supply chain, allowing companies to identify areas where emissions can be reduced.

6. Remote Work Solutions: With the rise of remote work, European IT companies are providing solutions that not only facilitate remote work but also reduce carbon emissions. By enabling employees to work from home, companies can significantly reduce the carbon emissions associated with commuting.

7. Environmental Impact Assessment Tools: Several European IT firms offer tools for conducting environmental impact assessments. These tools use carbon/non-carbon emissions data to assess the environmental impact of various activities, such as construction projects or industrial processes.

8. Energy Management Systems: IT solutions are being used to manage energy usage in buildings more efficiently. These systems use carbon/non-carbon emissions data to optimize energy usage, reducing the building's carbon footprint. 

9. Carbon Trading Platforms: IT companies are developing platforms for carbon trading, a market-based approach to reducing carbon emissions. These platforms use carbon/non-carbon emissions data to facilitate the buying and selling of emission allowances. 

10. Climate Change Modelling: IT solutions are being used to model the impacts of climate change. These models use carbon/non-carbon emissions data to predict future climate scenarios, helping policymakers to make informed decisions about climate change mitigation and adaptation.
