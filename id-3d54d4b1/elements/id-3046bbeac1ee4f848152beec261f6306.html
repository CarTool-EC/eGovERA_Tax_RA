Additional information: A Registered Excise Tax Payer is a business role that is responsible for the payment of excise taxes on certain goods and services, as mandated by European Taxes Regulation. This role is typically assumed by businesses that produce, store, receive or dispatch excisable goods such as alcohol, tobacco, and energy products. 

As a Registered Excise Tax Payer, the entity is required to comply with specific obligations. These include the accurate calculation and timely payment of excise taxes to the relevant tax authorities. The entity must also maintain detailed records of all transactions involving excisable goods, including production, storage, receipt, and dispatch. These records must be kept in a manner that allows for easy inspection and auditing by tax authorities.

The Registered Excise Tax Payer is also responsible for ensuring that all excisable goods are properly marked or labelled to indicate that excise tax has been paid. In some cases, the entity may be required to provide a financial guarantee, such as a bond, to cover potential excise tax liabilities.

Furthermore, the Registered Excise Tax Payer must comply with all relevant reporting requirements. This includes the submission of regular tax returns and other reports to the tax authorities, detailing the quantities of excisable goods produced, stored, received, and dispatched, as well as the amount of excise tax paid.

In the event of non-compliance with these obligations, the Registered Excise Tax Payer may be subject to penalties, including fines, seizure of goods, and revocation of their registration. Therefore, this role requires a thorough understanding of the European Taxes Regulation, as well as the ability to accurately calculate and pay excise taxes, maintain detailed records, and comply with all reporting requirements.

3. Fuel Distributor: A fuel distributor who imports or produces fuel such as gasoline, diesel, or kerosene is a registered excise tax payer. They are responsible for paying excise taxes on the fuel they distribute, which is calculated based on the volume of fuel.

4. Luxury Goods Retailer: A retailer who sells luxury goods such as high-end cars, jewelry, or yachts would be a registered excise tax payer. They are required to pay excise taxes on the luxury goods they sell, which is calculated based on the value of the goods.

5. Energy Provider: An energy provider who produces or imports energy products such as electricity, natural gas, or coal is a registered excise tax payer. They are responsible for paying excise taxes on the energy they provide, which is calculated based on the amount of energy.
