Additional information: Tangible assets information refers to the data and details related to physical or tangible assets owned by an organization. These assets are items or properties that have a physical existence and can be touched or felt. They include buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, inventories, land, and cash. 

In the context of information systems, tangible assets information is crucial for various reasons. Firstly, it helps in the accurate valuation of a company. The total value of a company's tangible assets is a key component of its total worth. Secondly, it aids in financial planning and decision-making. Information about tangible assets can guide decisions about asset acquisition, disposal, maintenance, and depreciation. 

Moreover, tangible assets information is essential for risk management. It helps identify assets that are at risk of damage, theft, or obsolescence, enabling proactive measures to protect these assets. It also supports compliance with financial reporting standards, which require companies to disclose the value of their tangible assets accurately.

In terms of data management, tangible assets information needs to be accurate, up-to-date, and readily accessible. It should be stored in a secure, reliable information system that allows for easy retrieval and analysis. The system should also support the tracking of asset lifecycles, from acquisition to disposal.

Furthermore, tangible assets information should be integrated with other types of business information, such as financial, operational, and strategic information. This integration enables a comprehensive view of the company's resources and performance, supporting informed decision-making and strategic planning.

In conclusion, tangible assets information is a vital component of business information. It provides insights into a company's resources, supports financial management and decision-making, aids in risk management, and contributes to compliance with financial reporting standards.

Example: 1. Real Estate Management: Tangible assets information is crucial in the real estate industry. For instance, property management companies use this information to manage their property portfolios. They need to know the value of each property, its location, size, condition, and other physical characteristics. This information helps them make decisions about property maintenance, rent pricing, and property sales or purchases.

2. Manufacturing Industry: In the manufacturing sector, tangible assets information is used in the management of machinery and equipment. Companies need to know the value, condition, and lifespan of their machinery to plan for maintenance, replacement, and depreciation. This information is also important for insurance purposes and for making decisions about investments in new machinery.

3. Retail Industry: Retail businesses use tangible assets information to manage their inventory. They need to know the quantity, value, and location of their stock to manage sales, reordering, and theft prevention. This information is also important for financial reporting and tax purposes.

4. Healthcare Sector: In the healthcare sector, tangible assets information is used in the management of medical equipment and facilities. Hospitals and clinics need to know the value, condition, and lifespan of their equipment to plan for maintenance, replacement, and depreciation. This information is also important for insurance purposes and for making decisions about investments in new equipment.

5. Public Sector: Government entities use tangible assets information to manage public infrastructure such as roads, bridges, buildings, and parks. This information is used to plan for maintenance, upgrades, and new projects. It is also important for financial reporting and for making decisions about public spending.

6. IT Industry: In the IT industry, tangible assets information is used to manage hardware such as servers, computers, and other equipment. This information is used to plan for maintenance, upgrades, and replacements. It is also important for financial reporting, insurance, and investment decisions.
