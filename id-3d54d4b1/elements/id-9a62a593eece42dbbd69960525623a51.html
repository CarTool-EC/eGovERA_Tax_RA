Additional information: SEED is an integral part of the Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS), which is a computerized system for monitoring the movement of excise goods within the EU. It is used by economic operators and national administrations to ensure that excise duties are correctly applied and collected. SEED is used to validate the excise numbers of the consignor, consignee, and transporter, and to provide a risk analysis for the consignment. It is a crucial tool for ensuring the correct application of excise duties and for preventing fraud.

Example: For instance, a company that produces alcoholic beverages in France and wants to transport them to a warehouse in Germany would use the SEED system. The French company would enter the details of the consignment into the EMCS, which would then use SEED to validate the excise numbers of the French company, the German warehouse, and the transporter. SEED would also provide a risk analysis for the consignment. Once the consignment has been delivered, the German warehouse would confirm receipt via the EMCS, and the excise duty would be paid in Germany.
