Additional information: The Tax Dataset Catalogues Catalogue is a comprehensive collection of various tax-related datasets and catalogues. It includes the Tax Base Amounts Registry, which records the base amounts for different taxes; the Local Tax Authorities, which lists the tax authorities at the local level; the Taxpayer Obligations Catalogue, which details the obligations of taxpayers; the Economic Activities Catalogue, which categorizes different economic activities for taxation purposes; the Catalogue of Assets that can be Confiscated, which lists assets that can be seized for tax purposes; the Excise Duty Catalogue, which details the excise duties on different goods and services; the Fiscal Data Sets Catalogue, which contains various fiscal data sets; the Harmonised Tax Catalogue, which provides a harmonised list of taxes; and the Taxpayer Rights Catalogue, which outlines the rights of taxpayers.

Example: For example, a tax authority could use the Tax Base Amounts Registry to determine the base amount for a particular tax. A taxpayer could refer to the Taxpayer Obligations Catalogue to understand their obligations. The Economic Activities Catalogue could be used by a business to understand how their activities are categorized for tax purposes. The Catalogue of Assets that can be Confiscated could be used by a tax authority to identify assets that can be seized in case of non-payment of taxes. The Excise Duty Catalogue could be used by a business to understand the excise duties on the goods or services they offer. The Fiscal Data Sets Catalogue could be used by researchers to analyze fiscal data. The Harmonised Tax Catalogue could be used by a multinational corporation to understand the taxes in different jurisdictions. The Taxpayer Rights Catalogue could be used by a taxpayer to understand their rights.
