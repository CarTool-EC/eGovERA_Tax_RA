As an ArchiMate business role, it represents a specific way of performing an organizational behavior, which is defined by a set of responsibilities, competencies, and obligations.

In the context of European Taxes Regulation, the Public Administration role involves the collection of taxes from individuals and businesses in accordance with European Union tax laws and regulations.
