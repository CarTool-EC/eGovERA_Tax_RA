Additional information: The Customs Authority role is responsible for implementing and enforcing the laws and regulations related to the import, export, and transit of goods. This includes the collection of customs duties, taxes, and related fees, as well as ensuring compliance with trade policies, regulations, and international agreements. 

The role involves the inspection of goods and documentation at border points to prevent illegal trade, such as smuggling, fraud, or evasion of duties. It also includes the assessment and collection of customs duties and taxes based on the value and type of goods, in accordance with the European Union's Common Customs Tariff.

The Customs Authority also plays a key role in facilitating legitimate trade. It provides information and guidance to traders on customs procedures, regulations, and tariff classifications. It also works with other government agencies and international organizations to streamline customs procedures and improve the efficiency of cross-border trade.

In the context of the ArchiMate business role, the Customs Authority is an active structure element that performs specific behaviors, which are defined by the customs laws and regulations. This role interacts with other roles and elements in the business layer, such as traders, transport operators, and regulatory agencies, to achieve its goals.

The Customs Authority role also involves risk management, such as identifying and addressing potential threats to the security of the supply chain. This includes the use of advanced technology and data analysis to target high-risk goods and operators, while facilitating the movement of low-risk trade.

Furthermore, the Customs Authority is responsible for protecting society by enforcing restrictions and prohibitions on certain goods, such as illegal drugs, weapons, and endangered species. It also plays a role in protecting the economic interests of the European Union and its member states by ensuring fair trade and competition.

3. Prevention of Smuggling: The Customs authority plays a crucial role in preventing smuggling and illegal trade. They inspect goods and vehicles at border crossings and other points of entry to detect and seize illegal goods.

4. Protection of Economic Interests: The Customs authority protects the economic interests of the EU by enforcing customs duties and trade regulations. This helps to maintain a level playing field for EU businesses and supports the internal market.

5. Ensuring Product Safety and Compliance: The Customs authority checks that products entering the EU market meet all relevant safety, health, and environmental standards. They may seize or destroy goods that do not comply with these standards.

6. Collection of Trade Data: The Customs authority collects data on the import and export of goods. This data is used for statistical purposes and to inform trade policy decisions.

7. Cooperation with Other Agencies: The Customs authority cooperates with other national and international agencies to enforce customs and trade regulations. This includes sharing information and collaborating on investigations.
