Additional information: Tax Professionals and Agents Registry Management is a crucial aspect of modern tax administration. It allows tax authorities to keep track of authorized tax professionals and agents, ensuring that they meet the necessary qualifications and standards. This system can also facilitate communication between tax authorities and tax professionals, and provide taxpayers with a reliable source of information when seeking professional tax assistance. The system can be designed to automatically update the registry based on changes in the status of tax professionals and agents, such as when they obtain new certifications or when their authorization is revoked.

Example: An example of the application of this concept is the IRS's 'Directory of Federal Tax Return Preparers with Credentials and Select Qualifications'. This online tool allows taxpayers to find tax professionals in their area who are currently authorized to prepare federal tax returns. Another example is the 'Agent Services' system used by the UK's HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), which provides a secure online platform for tax agents to interact with HMRC and manage their clients' tax affairs.
