These are often used in software licensing, cloud services, and online subscriptions.

Additional information: In the context of IT, interests and penalties are often financial in nature and are designed to enforce compliance with the terms and conditions of a service. For instance, a software license may stipulate that late payment of the license fee will result in a penalty. Similarly, a cloud service provider may charge interest on late payments. These penalties and interests are often calculated as a percentage of the amount due and are added to the total amount payable. They serve as a deterrent to late payment and non-compliance, and as a means for the service provider to recoup some of the costs associated with managing and chasing late payments.

Example: 1. A company using a SaaS product fails to pay the subscription fee by the due date. The service provider charges a late fee as a penalty. 2. A user exceeds their allocated storage limit on a cloud service. The service provider charges an additional fee (interest) for the extra storage used.
