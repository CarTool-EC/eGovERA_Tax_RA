This includes the application of laws and regulations related to taxation, the resolution of tax disputes, and the enforcement of tax compliance. It involves the use of digital systems for data collection, analysis, and reporting, as well as for communication and collaboration among stakeholders. This capability can enhance the efficiency, transparency, and fairness of tax justice administration, thereby contributing to public trust and fiscal sustainability.

Additional information: 'Tributary Justice Management' as a Digital Business Capability refers to the ability of an organization, typically within the public sector or legal industry, to effectively manage and execute all processes and operations related to tax-related legal matters using digital technology and systems. This includes the ability to handle tax disputes, tax fraud cases, tax evasion cases, and other tax-related legal issues.

This capability involves the use of digital tools and technologies to streamline and automate processes such as case management, document management, evidence management, workflow management, and reporting. It also includes the ability to use data analytics and artificial intelligence to identify patterns and trends in tax-related legal cases, predict outcomes, and make informed decisions.

Moreover, it involves the ability to ensure compliance with tax laws and regulations, protect the rights of taxpayers, and promote fairness and transparency in the tax system. It also includes the ability to collaborate and communicate effectively with various stakeholders, including taxpayers, legal professionals, government agencies, and the public, using digital channels.

Furthermore, this capability requires the organization to have the necessary digital infrastructure, systems, and skills to support these activities. It also requires the organization to have the ability to adapt to changes in tax laws and regulations, technological advancements, and societal expectations.

Lastly, 'Tributary Justice Management' as a Digital Business Capability involves the ability to manage risks and challenges associated with the use of digital technology in tax-related legal matters, such as data security, privacy, and ethical issues.

Example: 1. Online Tax Filing System: Many countries have implemented online systems for citizens to file their taxes. This digital capability allows for the efficient collection of tributary justice, as it simplifies the process for taxpayers and reduces the administrative burden on the government.

2. Digital Audit Systems: Governments use digital systems to audit businesses and individuals to ensure they are paying the correct amount of taxes. These systems can automatically analyze financial data to identify potential discrepancies or instances of tax evasion.

3. E-Court Systems: Some jurisdictions have implemented digital court systems to handle tax disputes. These systems allow for the submission of documents, scheduling of hearings, and even virtual court proceedings. This streamlines the process of tributary justice and makes it more accessible to the public.

4. Online Payment Platforms: Governments have developed online platforms for the payment of fines, fees, and taxes. These platforms make it easier for individuals and businesses to fulfill their financial obligations to the government.

5. Digital Property Assessment Systems: Local governments often use digital systems to assess the value of property for tax purposes. These systems can automatically gather data on property characteristics and market conditions to generate accurate assessments.

6. Electronic Customs Declaration: For countries with significant import and export activities, digital systems for customs declaration and duty payment streamline the process, reduce errors, and improve compliance.

7. Digital Taxpayer Services: Some tax authorities offer online portals where taxpayers can check their account status, arrange payment plans, apply for tax relief, and access other services. This improves the taxpayer experience and can increase compliance rates.
