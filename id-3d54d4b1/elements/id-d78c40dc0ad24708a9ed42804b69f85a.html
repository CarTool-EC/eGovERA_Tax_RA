Additional information: Tributary Justice Case Management systems are designed to streamline the process of managing cases by automating routine tasks, organizing case files, scheduling hearings, and tracking case progress. These systems can also provide analytics and reporting capabilities to help justice organizations make data-driven decisions. They can be used in various areas of tributary justice, including tax law, administrative law, and other areas where tributary justice is applied. The main goal of these systems is to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and increase transparency in the justice process.

Example: Examples of application include the use of case management software by tax courts to manage and track tax disputes, by administrative courts to handle administrative law cases, and by other tributary justice organizations to manage their case loads. These systems can also be used to manage the process of collecting fines and penalties, tracking the status of cases, and communicating with parties involved in cases.
