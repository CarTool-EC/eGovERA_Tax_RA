Additional information: The Tax Ombudsman is a crucial role in the European Taxes Regulation system, acting as an intermediary between taxpayers and the tax authorities. The primary responsibility of the Tax Ombudsman is to ensure that the rights of taxpayers are protected and their tax-related issues are addressed effectively and efficiently.

The Tax Ombudsman is tasked with investigating complaints from taxpayers about administrative actions, decisions, or procedures of the tax authorities. These complaints may relate to delays, errors, or unfair treatment. The Ombudsman is responsible for reviewing these complaints impartially and independently, and for making recommendations to resolve any identified issues.

In addition to handling individual complaints, the Tax Ombudsman also plays a broader role in improving the overall tax administration system. This includes identifying systemic issues and trends in taxpayer complaints, and making recommendations for administrative improvements to the tax authorities. The Ombudsman may also provide advice and guidance to taxpayers on their rights and obligations under the tax law.

The Tax Ombudsman is expected to maintain a high level of expertise in tax law and administration, and to act with integrity, impartiality, and independence. The Ombudsman must also have strong communication and negotiation skills, in order to effectively mediate between taxpayers and tax authorities, and to advocate for fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers.

As an ArchiMate business role, the Tax Ombudsman is represented as a specific way of performing work or conducting business within the tax administration system.
