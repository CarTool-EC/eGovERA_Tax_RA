This can include physical assets like property and vehicles, as well as digital assets like bank accounts and cryptocurrencies.

Source reference: https://www.techopedia.com/definition/14365/asset-management

Additional information: The management of confiscated assets is a complex task that requires accurate record-keeping and tracking. This is where IT comes into play. With the help of software systems, authorities can easily record details about the confiscated assets, including their nature, value, location, and the reason for their confiscation. These systems can also help in managing these assets, for instance, by facilitating their sale or disposal. Moreover, they can provide valuable analytics, such as trends in asset confiscation. The use of IT in this area not only increases efficiency but also transparency and accountability.

Example: Examples of application include law enforcement agencies using confiscated assets registry management systems to track seized properties in drug busts, or financial regulators using similar systems to manage assets seized in financial fraud cases. Another example could be the use of blockchain technology to track and manage confiscated digital assets like cryptocurrencies.
