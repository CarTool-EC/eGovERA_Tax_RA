It includes the specific rates of duty applicable to each item, and is typically used by businesses and individuals to determine the amount of excise duty they are required to pay.

Additional information: Excise duties are indirect taxes that are levied on certain goods, services, and activities. They are usually incorporated into the price of the product, and are often levied on goods and services that are considered harmful or linked to health issues, such as alcohol, tobacco, and gambling. The Excise Duty Catalogue is a crucial tool for businesses and individuals, as it provides detailed information on the specific rates of excise duty applicable to each item. It is important to note that the rates of excise duty can vary greatly depending on the country and the specific goods or services in question.

Example: For instance, a brewery would refer to the Excise Duty Catalogue to determine the amount of excise duty they are required to pay on the beer they produce. Similarly, a tobacco company would use the catalogue to find out the excise duty on the cigarettes they manufacture. In both cases, the excise duty is usually passed on to the consumer as part of the final price of the product.
