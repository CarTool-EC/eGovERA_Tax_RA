This information is crucial in international trade as it helps in determining the duties, tariffs, and trade measures that apply to the product. In the context of IT, this information can be stored, processed, and transmitted digitally to facilitate trade operations, compliance with customs regulations, and supply chain transparency.

Additional information: Non-preferential origin good information refers to the details about the country or region where a product or good was produced, manufactured, or significantly transformed, without considering any special treatment or trade agreements that might exist between the country of origin and the country of import. This information is crucial for various reasons, including customs duties, consumer protection, and statistical purposes.

In the context of international trade, non-preferential origin rules are used to determine the origin of goods for the application of most-favored-nation treatment (MFN). This is the basic level of treatment that World Trade Organization (WTO) members accord to each other.

The non-preferential origin of goods is typically determined by the 'substantial transformation' criterion, which means that the product has undergone a significant process of manufacturing or processing that results in a new or distinct article of commerce.

In the IT sector, this could refer to the country where a piece of hardware was assembled or where software was developed. For example, a computer may have components from various countries, but if it was assembled in Germany, its non-preferential origin would be Germany.

This information is crucial for businesses and consumers alike. For businesses, it helps to understand the supply chain, comply with international trade regulations, and potentially avoid customs duties. For consumers, it provides transparency about the product's origin, which can influence purchasing decisions based on factors such as quality, ethical standards, or support for local industries.

In the European context, the non-preferential origin of goods is governed by the Union Customs Code and its implementing regulations. These rules set out the criteria for determining the non-preferential origin of goods, including the concept of 'last substantial transformation'.

Example: 1. Import and Export Business: Non-preferential origin good information is crucial in the import and export business. For instance, a company importing goods from China to Spain needs to know the non-preferential origin of the goods to comply with the EU's customs regulations. This information is used to determine the amount of duty to be paid and whether the goods meet the required standards and regulations.

2. Supply Chain Management: In supply chain management, non-preferential origin good information is used to track and manage goods. For example, a German automobile manufacturer sourcing parts from various countries needs to know the non-preferential origin of these parts. This information helps in planning logistics, managing inventory, and ensuring compliance with regulations.

3. E-commerce: In the e-commerce sector, non-preferential origin good information is used to provide customers with accurate product information. For example, an online retailer selling products sourced from different countries needs to provide non-preferential origin information to customers. This helps customers make informed purchasing decisions and ensures transparency.

4. Food Industry: In the food industry, non-preferential origin good information is used to ensure food safety and quality. For instance, a restaurant sourcing ingredients from different countries needs to know the non-preferential origin of these ingredients. This information helps in ensuring the ingredients meet the required food safety standards and regulations.

5. Manufacturing: In the manufacturing sector, non-preferential origin good information is used in the production process. For example, a French electronics manufacturer sourcing components from various countries needs to know the non-preferential origin of these components. This information helps in ensuring the components meet the required quality standards and regulations.
