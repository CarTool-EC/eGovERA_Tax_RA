This includes agreements for sharing tax data electronically, agreements with tax intermediaries, and agreements on the Digital Single Gateway.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The Tax Organisational Agreements Catalogue ABB is a comprehensive collection of various agreements that are crucial in the tax organization and management. The first element, 'Agreements to Share tax Data Electronically', refers to contracts that allow for the digital sharing of tax data between entities. The second element, 'Agreements with tax intermediaries', refers to contracts between tax authorities and intermediaries, such as tax consultants, accountants, or legal advisors, who play a role in the tax process. The third element, 'Agreements on Digital Single Gateway', refers to contracts that establish a single digital point of access for taxpayers to interact with tax authorities.

Example: An example of 'Agreements to Share tax Data Electronically' could be an agreement between two countries to share tax data to prevent tax evasion. An example of 'Agreements with tax intermediaries' could be a contract between a tax authority and a tax consulting firm that outlines the responsibilities and obligations of each party. An example of 'Agreements on Digital Single Gateway' could be an agreement to establish a unified online platform for taxpayers to file taxes, check their tax status, and communicate with tax authorities.
