Additional information: The Agreements to Share Tax Data Electronically is a formalized arrangement between two or more parties, typically tax authorities of different jurisdictions, to exchange tax-related information electronically. This agreement is designed to enhance transparency, improve efficiency, and promote cooperation among tax authorities, thereby helping to prevent tax evasion and fraud.

Under this agreement, tax authorities agree to share various types of tax data, including but not limited to, income details, capital gains, bank account information, and other financial and tax-related data. The data is shared electronically, often through secure networks or platforms, to ensure the confidentiality and security of the information.

The agreement usually outlines the types of data to be shared, the frequency of data exchange, the methods and standards for data transmission, and the responsibilities and obligations of each party. It also includes provisions on data protection and privacy to comply with relevant laws and regulations.

In the context of the ArchiMate business role, the Agreements to Share Tax Data Electronically is a role played by a tax authority or other organization that is responsible for implementing and managing the electronic data exchange process. This role involves ensuring that the data is accurately and timely shared, maintaining the security and integrity of the data, and complying with the terms of the agreement and applicable laws and regulations.

Example: 1. Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI): This agreement allows tax authorities to exchange non-residential financial account information automatically, reducing the chance for tax evasion. It involves the systematic and periodic transmission of taxpayer information by the source country to the residence country concerning various categories of income.

2. Common Reporting Standard (CRS): Developed by the OECD, the CRS calls on jurisdictions to obtain information from their financial institutions and automatically exchange that information with other jurisdictions on an annual basis. It sets out the financial account information to be exchanged, the financial institutions required to report, the different types of accounts and taxpayers covered, as well as common due diligence procedures to be followed by financial institutions.

3. Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC): The European Union's DAC provides for the exchange of information between EU member states' tax administrations, including automatic exchanges for certain categories of income and capital. The directive has been updated several times to expand the scope of information covered.

4. FATCA Agreement: The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act is a United States federal law requiring all non-U.S. foreign financial institutions (FFIs) to search their records for customers with indicia of a connection to the U.S., including indications in records of birth or prior residency in the U.S., or the like, and to report the assets and identities of such persons to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

5. Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA): Under the MCAA, signatories exchange information automatically based on Article 6 of the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters. The MCAA specifies the details of what information will be exchanged and when, as it is the operational manifestation of the CRS.
