This includes the ability to register new professionals, update information, track their credentials, and monitor their performance. It also involves ensuring the security and privacy of the data, as well as its accessibility for authorized users. This capability is crucial for regulatory compliance, quality assurance, and efficient service delivery in the tax industry.

Additional information: The 'Tax Professionals Registry Management' Digital Business Capability refers to the ability of an organization, particularly those in the financial sector, to effectively manage a comprehensive database or registry of tax professionals. This capability involves the use of digital technologies and systems to collect, store, manage, and analyze data related to tax professionals.

This includes personal information, professional qualifications, areas of expertise, years of experience, and other relevant details. It also involves managing the status of these professionals, such as active, inactive, or under review, based on various factors such as their performance, compliance with tax laws and regulations, and ethical standards.

The capability enables the organization to efficiently track and monitor the performance and activities of registered tax professionals, ensuring they meet the required standards and comply with the relevant tax laws and regulations.
