These include European harmonised tax data policies, book-keeping data policies, tax audit policies, the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS), tax open data policies, tax retention policies, and tax data lifecycle guidelines. Each of these elements represents a specific aspect of tax data policy and is described as a Business-object.

Additional information: The Tax Data Policies Catalogue ABB is a comprehensive collection of policies and guidelines that govern the management, use, and sharing of tax data. It includes policies that are harmonised across Europe, ensuring consistency and comparability of tax data across different jurisdictions. It also includes policies related to book-keeping, tax audits, and the use of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS), which is an international standard for classifying traded products. The catalogue also covers policies related to the open sharing of tax data, the retention of tax data, and guidelines for managing the lifecycle of tax data.

Example: These policies ensure that tax data is consistent and comparable across different European jurisdictions.
These policies govern how book-keeping data, which is crucial for tax purposes, is managed and used.
These policies provide guidelines for conducting tax audits, including the use of tax data.
This is an international standard for classifying traded products, and its use is governed by specific policies.
These policies govern the sharing of tax data in an open and transparent manner.
These policies provide guidelines for how long tax data should be retained.
These guidelines provide a framework for managing tax data throughout its lifecycle, from creation and use to disposal.
