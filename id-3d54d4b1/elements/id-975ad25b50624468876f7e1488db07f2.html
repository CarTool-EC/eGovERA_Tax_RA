Example: 1. Online Tax Filing Systems: Many governments have implemented online systems that allow taxpayers to file their taxes. This not only makes the process more efficient for the government but also easier for the taxpayer. For example, the IRS in the United States has an online system called IRS Free File that allows taxpayers to prepare and file their federal tax returns online for free.

2. Digital Communication Platforms: Governments use digital platforms to communicate with taxpayers and stakeholders. For example, the UK government uses GOV.UK to provide information about taxes, benefits, and other services. It also allows users to pay their taxes online, apply for benefits, and access other services.

3. Stakeholder Engagement Platforms: Some governments have implemented digital platforms to engage with stakeholders. For example, the Australian government has a platform called 'Have Your Say' where stakeholders can participate in consultations and provide feedback on proposed government policies or projects.

4. Social Media Channels: Governments use social media channels to communicate with taxpayers and stakeholders. For example, the Canada Revenue Agency uses Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to provide tax tips, updates on tax laws, and other information.

5. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems: Governments use CRM systems to manage their relationships with taxpayers and stakeholders. For example, the City of Philadelphia in the United States uses a CRM system to manage its interactions with residents, businesses, and visitors.

6. Online Complaint and Feedback Systems: Governments use online systems to receive and manage complaints and feedback from taxpayers and stakeholders. For example, the Indian government has a portal called 'Public Grievance' where citizens can lodge complaints about any government department or service.

7. Digital Outreach Programs: Governments use digital outreach programs to educate taxpayers and stakeholders about their rights and responsibilities. For example, the IRS in the United States has a program called 'Taxpayer Outreach' that provides information and resources to help taxpayers understand and meet their tax responsibilities.
