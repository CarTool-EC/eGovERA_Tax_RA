These solutions include the Common Data Model (CDM) and eProcurement Data Model Solutions, which are designed to standardize and structure data for efficient use and interoperability.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The Business Agnostic Data Model Solutions ABB includes the Common Data Model (CDM), an ontology based on the FRBR model (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records) that uses RDF(S)/OWL technologies to represent relationships between resource types. This model is particularly useful in the Publications Office, where it can represent various views of resources within the scope of the FRBR model. Another key element of this grouping is the eProcurement Data Model Solutions, which includes the European Single Procurement Document (ESPD). The ESPD is a standardized form used in public procurement processes within the European Union (EU) that serves as a preliminary self-declaration by suppliers, demonstrating their eligibility and suitability to participate in public procurement procedures across EU member states.

Example: For example, the Common Data Model can be used by a Publications Office to manage and represent relationships between various resource types, such as books, articles, and other publications. On the other hand, the eProcurement Data Model Solutions, particularly the ESPD, can be used by suppliers and contractors to provide essential information about their company, including identification, financial standing, technical and professional abilities, and any legal grounds for exclusion, during public procurement processes within the EU.
